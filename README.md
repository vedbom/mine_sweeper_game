# mine_sweeper_game
Mine Sweeper clone created in the Processing programming environment.
To play the game:
- Click on a square using the right mouse button (RMB) to reveal the number of mines surrounding it
- Clicking on a square containing a mine will end the game
- You can use the left mouse button (LMB) to add a warning to squares you suspect are mines (this will not stop you from clicking on them!!!)
- Continue revealing the squares this way until all but the ones containing mines are revealed
